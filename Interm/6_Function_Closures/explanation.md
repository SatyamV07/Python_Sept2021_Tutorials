# Python Closure Functions

&nbsp;

### In Python we can define functions inside of other functions,

### This allows us to do

```
1. Encapsulation of Code
2. Closures
3. Decorators
```

- ### Python supports several different coding paradigms, including functional programming

- ### Functional Programming frequently uses closures

- ### Closures allow the creation of Decorators are a handy way of doing pre- and post-conditions on a wrapped functions

&nbsp;
### In this course we are learn about

```
1. Defining inner functions
2. Using inner functions as helper functions
3. Building function closures
4. Using captured variables in a closure
5. Captured data functions in a closure
6. Decorators - We discuss as a seperate topic later
```

### Overview

```
1. Python supports procedural, object oriented and functional programming
2. Functional Programming relies on functions in the way the object oriented programming relies on objects 
3. Closures are a way of wrapping data with a function
4. Closures use an inner function and capture variables to encapsulate execution and data
5. Inner functions are functions defined within functions
6. Decorators are a special case of closures where you use functions to wrap the execution to other functions
```
