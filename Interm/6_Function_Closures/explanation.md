# Python Closure Functions

&nbsp;

### In Python we can define functions inside of other functions

### This allows us to do

- Encapsulation of Code
- Closures
- Decorators
  
### Python supports several different coding paradigms, including functional programming

### Functional Programming frequently uses closures

### Closures allow the creation of Decorators are a handy way of doing pre- and post-conditions on a wrapped functions

## In this course we are learn about

1. Defining inner functions
2. Using inner functions as helper functions
3. Building function closures
4. Using captured variables in a closure
5. Captured data functions in a closure
6. Decorators - We discuss as a seperate topic later
