# Python Lambda Functions

&nbsp;

### Python lambdas are little, anonymous functions, subject to a more restrictive but more concise syntax than regular Python functions.

#### Lambda expressions in Python and other programming languages have their roots in lambda calculus, a model of computation invented by Alonzo Church.

Python and other languages like Java, C#, and even C++ 
have had lambda functions added to their syntax, whereas languages like 
LISP or the ML family of languages, Haskell, OCaml, and F#, use lambdas as 
a core concept.


#### Basic Syntax 
```python
lambda x: x
```
- The keyword: lambda
- A bound variable: x
- A body: x
