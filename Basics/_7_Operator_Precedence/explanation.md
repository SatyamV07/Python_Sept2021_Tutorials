# Python Operator Precedence

&nbsp;

## Python supports below operators

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Assignment operators
4. Logical operators
5. Bitwise operators
6. Membership operators
7. Identity operators

&nbsp;

### Arithmetic Operators

> *used to perform mathematical operations*

|Operator|Meaning|
|:-|:-:|
|+|Add two operands or unary plus|
|-|Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus|
|*|Multiply two operands|
|/|Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float)|
|%|Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right|
|//|Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line|
|**|Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right|

&nbsp;

### Comparision Operators

> *used to compare values returns only true or false*

|Operator|Meaning|
|:-|:-:|
|>|Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right|
|<|Less than - True if left operand is less than the right|
|==|Equal to - True if both operands are equal|
|!=|Not equal to - True if operands are not equal|
|>=|Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right|
|<=|Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right|

&nbsp;
### Logical Operators

> *logic gate operations*

|Operator|	Meaning	|
|:-|:-:|
|and|True if both the operands are true|
|or|True if either of the operands is true|
|not|True if operand is false (complements the operand)|

&nbsp;
### Bitwise Operators

> *Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bits*

|Operator|	Meaning|
|:-|:-:|
|&|	Bitwise AND|
|\||Bitwise OR|
|~|Bitwise NOR|
|^|Bitwise XOR|
|>>|Bitwise right shift|
|<<|Bitwise left shift|


&nbsp;
### Assignment Operators

> *to assign values to variables*

|Operator|
|:-:|
|=|      
|+=|	       
|-=|       
|*=|      
|/=|     
|%=|    
|//=|       
|**=|      
|&=| 
|\|=|    
|^=|
|>>=|
|<<=|   

&nbsp;
### Identity Operators

> *used to check if two values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical.*

|Operator	|Meaning|
|:-|:-:|
|is|True if the operands are identical (refer to the same object)|
|is not	|True if the operands are not identical (do not refer to the same object)|

&nbsp;

### Membership Operators

> *used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary).*

|Operator|Meaning|
|:-|:-:|
|in	|True if value/variable is found in the sequence|
|not in|True if value/variable is not found in the sequence|
