# Python NameSpaces


&nbsp;

#### **A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information about the object that each name references. You can think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the values are the objects themselves. Each key-value pair maps a name to its corresponding object.**

*We will talk about variable scopes later to get deeper insight on namespaces*
