# Python Operator Precedence

&nbsp;

## Python supports below operators

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Assignment operators
4. Logical operators
5. Bitwise operators
6. Membership operators
7. Identity operators

&nbsp;

### Arithmetic operators

> *used to perform mathematical operations*

|Operator|Meaning|
|:-|:-:|
|+|Add two operands or unary plus|
|-|Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus|
|*|Multiply two operands|
|/|Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float)|
|%|Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right|
|//|Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line|
|**|Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right|

&nbsp;

### Comparision operators

> *used to compare values returns only true or false*

|Operator|Meaning|
|:-|:-:|
|>|Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right|
|<|Less than - True if left operand is less than the right|
|==|Equal to - True if both operands are equal|
|!=|Not equal to - True if operands are not equal|
|>=|Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right|
|<=|Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right|

&nbsp;
### Logical operators

> *logic gate operations*

|Operator|	Meaning	|
|:-|:-:|
|and|True if both the operands are true|
|or|True if either of the operands is true|
|not|True if operand is false (complements the operand)|
